           This program is part of an exercice from an online C# course
           (available at openclassrooms.com) named "RÃ©alisez un tirage 
           de loto" aka "Build your own Lottery Draw algorithm".

            - What it does?
        
            When executed, this program will a open a console window 
            where 7 numbers ranging from 1 to 49 (included) will be 
            displayed. It is important to note that all numbers are 
            unique and not equal to any of the others.
